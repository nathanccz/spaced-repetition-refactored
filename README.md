# Spaced Repetition

Welcome to my **Spaced Repetition** repository!

This web app was built as a complimentary tool to Anki, the popular spaced repetition learning tool. It's inspired by the "magical spreadsheet" concept: You build out a list of high-level topics for each field of knowledge you're studying, then test your ability to recall the information you've learned in each topic.
